=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<super_table_creator> creates the MySQL database tables for use with
B<super_mediator> TEXT Exporters.  B<super_mediator> exports deep packet
inspection and flow information to CSV Files.  CSV files can be imported
into databases using tools such as mysqlimport.

=head1 OPTIONS

The following options configure where B<super_table_creator> creates
database tables and which tables to create.

=over 4

=item B<--out> I<MYSQL_DB_HOSTNAME>

I<MYSQL_DB_HOSTNAME> is the hostname or IP address where the MySQL
Database lives.  Default is localhost.

=item B<--name> I<MYSQL_USER_NAME>

I<MYSQL_USER_NAME> is the user name to use when connecting to the MySQL
server.  Default is root.

=item B<--pass> I<MYSQL_PASSWORD>

I<MYSQL_PASSWORD> is the password to use when connecting to the MySQL
server. No Default.

=item B<--database> I<DATABASE_NAME>

I<DATABASE_NAME> is the name of the database to create, or the name
of the pre-existing database to create the table(s).

=item B<--version>

Print the version and exit.

=item B<--flow-only>

Create the full flow table and exit.  The full flow table has the following
fields:

    reason         | VARCHAR(10)     | flow end reason

=item B<--no-index>

If present, put flow index information into each table.  Otherwise, a
separate flow index table is created and it will be necessary to join the flow
index table with the application protocol table to retrieve all information
related to a particular flow.  The following fields will be added to each DPI table
in place of the flow key hash, stime, and obid:

    column name    | size            | description

    obid           | INT             | observation ID of the flow sensor

=item B<--dns-dedup>

If present, create the default DNS deduplication table and exit.  The default
table consists of 4 columns.  If using the I<LAST_SEEN> option in the
super_mediator.conf(1) file, use the I<--dedup-last-seen> option.  The
default DNS deduplication has the following columns:

    column name    | size            | description

    first_seen     | DATETIME        | flow start time DNS Record was first seen.

    rrtype         | MEDIUMINT       | type of resource record (A, NS, CNAME, etc.)

    rrname         | VARCHAR(270)    | domain name found in RNAME in Resource Record

    rrval          | VARCHAR(300)    | RDATA in Resource Record

=item B<--dedup-last-seen>

If present, create the extended DNS deduplication table and exit.  The extended
table consists of 6 columns, the above 4 columns plus the last time seen and the
hit count:

    column name    | size            | description

    first_seen     | DATETIME        | flow start time DNS Record was first seen.

    last_seen      | DATETIME        | flow start time of last record seen before export

    hitcount       | INT             | number of records seen between first_seen and last_seen.

    rrval          | VARCHAR(300)    | RDATA in Resource Record

=item B<--flow-stats>

If present, create the flow statistics table.  As of B<yaf> 2.3.0, B<yaf> will
export extended flow information if B<yaf> is run with B<--flow-stats>.
B<super_mediator> will collect and export this information in CSV format,
if available.  The table will be created in the following format:

    column name    | size            | description

    flow_key       | INT             | flow key hash

    stime          | BIGINT          | flow start time

    revavgdata     | BIGINT          | average payload length in reverse direction

=item B<--yaf-stats>

If present, create the yaf process statistics table, "yaf_stats".
As of B<yaf> 2.0.0, B<yaf> will export process statistics every 5 minutes
by default.  B<super_mediator> will collect and write this information to
the log file and to the TEXT exporters.  It is possible to configure an
exporter to only process yaf statistics so they can be imported to a database.
The following table can be used to store yaf process statistics.

    column name      | size            | description

    ts               | TIMESTAMP       | auto insert the current time

    yaf_id           | INT             | observation domain of exporter

    flow_rate        | INT             | mean flow rate

    packet_rate      | INT             | mean packet rate

=item B<--dedupflow>

If present, add a column between id and data for the hit count which is
present when B<super_mediator> is configured with B<DEDUP_PER_FLOW>.  This
option can be used with existing tables as it modifies the tables after
initially creating them.  This option only modifies the HTTP, SLP, IMAP,
SMTP, POP3, IRC, FTP, SIP, RTSP, SSH, MODBUS, and ENIP tables.  The other
protocols are not affected by the DEDUP_PER_FLOW option.

=item B<--dedup> I<TABLE_NAME>

If present, add the table with I<TABLE_NAME> to the database given
to B<--database> and exit.  This table's schema corresponds with the CSV output
format of files produced by the DEDUP_CONFIG configuration.  This table will
have the following schema:

    column name      | size            | description

    first_seen       | DATETIME        | first time ip, data tuple was seen

    last_seen        | DATETIME        | last time ip, data tuple was seen

    ip               | VARCHAR(40)     | src or dst ipv4 or ipv6 address

    hash             | INT             | flow key hash of last flow with ip, data tuple

    hitcount         | BIGINT          | number of times ip, data tuple was seen

    data             | VARCHAR(500)    | data that corresponds with configured info element ID

=item B<--ssl-certs>

If present add the following two tables to the database specified by
B<--database> and exit.  These two tables correspond to the CSV output
format of the SSL_DEDUP_ONLY and SSL_DEDUP configurations in B<super_mediator>.
The certs table stores characteristics of certificates (CERT_FILE) and the certs_dedup
table stores certificate metadata and hitcounts.  The certs table has the following
schema:

    column name      | size            | description

    serial           | VARCHAR(150)    | serial number of X.509 Certificate

    issuer           | VARCHAR(500)    | Issuer's common name in X.509 Certificate

    id               | INT             | the object/member ID of the data

    ISE              | VARCHAR(2)      | Issuer(I), Subject(S), Extension(E)

    cert_no          | SMALLINT        | Order in certificate chain

    data             | VARCHAR(500)    | data that corresponds with id

The certs_dedup table will have the following schema:

    column name      | size            | description

    first_seen       | DATETIME        | first time ip, data tuple was seen

    last_seen        | DATETIME        | last time ip, data tuple was seen

    serial           | VARCHAR(150)    | serial number of X.509 Certificate

    hitcount         | BIGINT          | number of times ip, data tuple was seen

    issuer           | VARCHAR(500)    | Issuer's common name in X.509 Certificate

=item B<--ssl-dedup>

If present, create the ssl_ip_dedup table that follows the same format
as SSL certificate de-duplicated data configured in the DEDUP_CONFIG block
of B<super_mediator.conf(1)> and exit.
This certificate information is de-duplicated
by IP address and certificate chain.  It has the following schema:

    column name      | size            | description

    first_seen       | DATETIME        | first time ip, cert chain was seen

    hash             | INT             | flow key hash of last flow with ip, cert chain tuple

    hitcount         | BIGINT          | number of times ip, cert chain was seen

    serial1          | VARCHAR(150)    | serial number of End-user certificate

    issuer1          | VARCHAR(500)    | Issuer's common name of End-user Certificate

    serial2          | VARCHAR(150)    | serial number of Intermediate/Root CA certificate

    issuer2          | VARCHAR(500)    | Issuer's common name of Intermediate/Root CA Certificate
