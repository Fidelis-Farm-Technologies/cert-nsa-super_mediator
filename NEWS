Version 2.0.0.alpha3 (2023-12-21)
=================================

Added a new template for export of de-duplicated DNS AAAA records to resolve an issue where a binary IPv6 address was being stored in an IPFIX string.
Changed JSON output to print Unicode when an IPFIX string includes valid UTF-8 encoded Unicode and changed how invalid UTF-8 data is printed.

Version 1.10.0 (2023-12-21)
===========================

Added support for updated TLS and SSH templates generated by YAF 2.15 containing the JA3- and HASSH-related elements.
Added a new template for export of de-duplicated DNS AAAA records to resolve an issue where a binary IPv6 address was being stored in an IPFIX string.
In the JSON output of TLS certificates, replaced some sslObjectIdXX labels with meaningful names.
Fixed a bug where an IPv4 address of 0.0.0.0 was printed as the IPv6 address ::.
Fixed a bug in the JSON output of an SMTP subrecord when it was followed by an additional subrecord.
Fixed a compilation error when including SiLK support and SiLK was built without IPv6 support.

Version 2.0.0.alpha2 (2023-02-09)
=================================

Re-enabled the ability to filter using an IPSet which was left unimplemented in 2.0.0.alpha1.
Fixed a crash in the SSL_DEDUP code introduced in 2.0.0.alpha1.
Fixed bug by ensuring that PRESERVE_OBDOMAIN is handled individually for each template.
Ensured that JSON output uses a unique key for each entry in an object.
Changed text output of firstEightNonEmptyPacketDirections to display in base-2.
Improved compatibility with very old versions of YAF.

Version 1.9.1 (2023-02-09)
==========================

Made the configure test for OpenSSL more robust to support newer releases.
Fixed a compilation error on some systems due to a misplaced #include.

Version 1.9.0 (2022-06-08)
==========================

Added support for labeling records based on data from a SiLK IPSet or a SiLK Prefix Map.
Added support for labeling records with a sensor and flowtype similar to SiLK's rwflowpack tool.
Added support for OpenSSL 3.0.1.
Changed JSON output of SSL records for unknown sslObjectType values: For unknown value X, key sslCertObjectIDX is replaced by sslCertIssuerObjectIdX or sslCertSubObjectIdX.  When X is 1, EmailAddress is used (e.g., sslCertIssuerEmailAddress) and when X is 25 DomainComponent is used.
Changed the super_mediator.spec file to configure the build using --with FEATURE options to rpmbuild.
Fixed a small bug in JSON output of rewritten SSL certificates.
Fixed bugs in TEXT export of very old YAF SSL data.
Changed the template scopes for the YAF stats template and Tombstone template to match those used by YAF.

Version 2.0.0.alpha1 (2022-02-24)
=================================

Increased the flexibility of super_mediator by eliminating most internal template definitions and having it use the incoming template definitions instead.
Changed the syntax of the configuration file; previous versions of the files need to be updated.
Made changes to the command line parsing and eliminated several options.  The configuration file is the preferred way to configure super_mediator.
Enhanced statistics for types of records read from a collector and written to an exporter.
Temporarily disabled SiLK IPset and MySQL support.
Note: Exporting as delimited TEXT is lightly tested and contains bugs.
Updated the fixbuf requirement to libfixbuf-3.0.0.

Version 1.8.0 (2020-12-22)
==========================

Added a new switch, --rewrite-ssl-certs, which restructures the template used for TLS/SSL certificates for IPFIX exporters.  The template uses specific IEs for some fields in an SSL certificate.  The --rewrite-ssl-certs switch also allows a super_mediator to read the new SSL template from an upstream super_mediator.  Deduplication of the rewritten certificates is not supported.
Added the ability to read the new SMTP DPI records exported by YAF 2.12.0.
Added the observation domain ID to JSON output.

Version 1.7.4 (2020-02-11)

Note that super_mediator is UNABLE to read data that uses the new format.
Fixed a JSON formatting bug for empty SSL DPI records.

Version 1.7.1 (2019-10-24)

Added ability to preserve observation domain of incoming records.
